# File format specifications for tertiary single-cell RNA-seq analysis

## Motivation

Post-quantification (tertiary) analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data involves a number of related operations by large and diverse set of tools working with diverse format specifications for files describing inputs and outputs (clusters, trajectories etc). This repository will hold format specifications in an effort to crystalise some of these specifications.

## Current specifications
